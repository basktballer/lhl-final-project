# Final Project - Budget Sharing

## Getting Started
clone the repo down into a folder.

There are two folders within the root.

1. Server:
The server is a PostgresSQL Database with Rails built ontop of it.
Its purpose is to handle data, and export a JSON api.

2. Client:
The client folder is a react app built seperately from the server.
This is just React.
